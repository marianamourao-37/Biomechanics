In order to read the EMG data and obtain the results in plots you must follow these steps:

1ºstep->Open the Read_EMG.m script in MATLAB

2ºstep-> Select one file regarding the movement you want to analyse.
Note: You just have to choose between 'PD2_data_rm.tsv' or 'Mountain Climber_data_rm.tsv'

3ºstep->When selecting the file, it will appear a question if you want to analyse the 
raw EMG data (without normalization), the raw RMS data or the EMG normalized data, by
writing, EMG, RMS or Normalized_EMG_RMS_data, respectively.

4ºstep->After the selection of the data to analyse, it will appear 4 subplots regarding the data choosen.

the mentioned function is inside the folder named Implementation_Dynamic_Analysis.

     Please take into consideration that for each of the steps mentioned, the choice of the aforementioned 
files will lead to the analysis of the motion selected. 
     For that reason, if it is intended to analyse the other movement, please repeat the second step, 
chossing the other option.
